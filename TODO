- Item set support for item-based conditions
- Reusable item sets
- Pre-defined item sets (eg. mana potions, health potions, foods, drinks, etc).
- Item set import/export
- Add 'macro' to action type (ie. not just spell / item) to look for buttons by macro name

- Default rotations for all classes (classic @ 60, retail @ 120).
- Key Bindings

(another addon probably):
- Create custom buttons that also support item sets
