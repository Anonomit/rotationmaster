- Add some default item sets (different from classic vs. retail)
- Add some kind of in-addon help.

- Add 'macro' to action type (ie. not just spell / item) to look for buttons by macro name - requires major rewrite of highlighting code

- Default rotations for all classes (classic @ 60, retail @ 120).
